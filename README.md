# DataCareerPlanning_PartTwo

For part two of this project into career planning, I created a story looking more indepth at company location versus employee residence, employment type available at each experience level, and cost of living comparisons.  My favorite visualization I created compared company size to ratio of available remote work.  I was interested in finding out if a specific size company offered more remote options for work.  I discovered no strong correlation between a company's size and the remote work offered.
